Rewrite: make installation easier (how?)
Feature: add optional "extraPackages=false" option to update.bat to add .Net runtime
Docs: split documentation into seperate file (published Google doc)
Rewrite: Less text, more pictures
Docs: document what "Installer" program does better
Docs: document what happens when winPE.wim boots by default
Docs: document each script better
Docs: link to third party apps able to run in PE (such as WinPE_SE projects)
Rewrite: fully support PE50 (not updating to 51 should not break anything)
Rewrite: enumerate tools\ directory (if present) and dynamically add each path to environment in at runtime
Feature: Finish writing addDrivers.bat
